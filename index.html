                     	<p> The Premier League, often referred to outside the UK as the English Premier League, or sometimes the EPL, <p>(legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited) is the top level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs,<p>
                       it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL).<p>
                     	<p>
                     		In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the "big five" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner.[26] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from The Football League.[27] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[28] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.[29] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for Premier League with FA the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[24]

Serie A led the UEFA ranking from 1986 to 1988 and from 1990 to 1999.[5]
